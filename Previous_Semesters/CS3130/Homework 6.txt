Homework 6 Jonathan Pilling

Problem (1)
(a) What is the proportion of people who smoke?
    Answer: 0.03 + 0.44 = 0.47
(b) What is the proportion of people who have had a heart attack?
    Answer: 0.03 + 0.03 = 0.06
(c)  If a person is a smoker, are they more likely to have had a heart attack than someone
who is not a smoker? Hint: Be careful what this question is asking!
    Answer: No, 0.03 = 0.03
(d) If someone tells you that they have had a heart attack, what is the probability that they
are also a smoker?
    Answer: 0.03
(e) Is smoking independent of having a heart attack?
    Answer: Yes, the joint probabilities are the same
(f) Define Bernoulli random variables, S = 0 (non-smoker), S = 1 (smoker), and H = 0 (no
heart attack), H = 1 (heart attack). What is Cov(S, H)?  

(g) What is œÅ(S, H)?
